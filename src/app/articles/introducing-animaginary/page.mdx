When you’re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked more realistic than reality itself.

To make this possible, we needed to squeeze every drop of performance out of the browser possible. And so Animaginary was born.

```js
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  )
}
```

Animaginary is our new web animation library that redefines what you thought was possible on the web. Hand-written in optimized WASM, Animaginary can even animate the `height` property of an element at 60fps.

## Performance Optimizations

One of the key focuses during the development of Animaginary was performance. Here are some of the optimizations we implemented:

1. **Efficient DOM Updates**: Animaginary minimizes DOM manipulations by using a virtual DOM-like approach for animations.
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Where possible, we leverage CSS transforms and opacity for smooth, GPU-accelerated animations.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Animation calculations are performed on-demand, reducing the initial load time of your web applications.

## Real-world Applications

Animaginary has already been adopted by several high-profile websites, including e-commerce platforms, interactive data visualizations, and educational apps. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with developers praising its ease of use and performance benefits.

## Looking Ahead

The future of Animaginary is exciting. We're currently working on:

1. Integration with popular frontend frameworks like Vue and Svelte
2. Expanded library of pre-built animations
3. Advanced 3D animation capabilities using WebGL

## Conclusion

Developing Animaginary has been a journey of pushing the limits of web animation technology. It's a testament to how far we've come in web development and a glimpse into the future of interactive web experiences. I invite fellow developers to try out Animaginary and join us in revolutionizing web animations.

Stay tuned for more updates and happy animating!
